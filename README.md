The Band template website is a site that is ideally being developed for a band. I’ve spoken to two friends’ bands who were interested in having me create a website for them, and I’m awaiting the official content from them. Being so, I would like to create a structure that allows them to easily update the content when they want to notify fans of a new release or an event that they are playing. Most of these bands have become reliant on social media such as Instagram youtube, and I would like the page to react to those feeds. The page will also redirect to the bands’ download or streaming links according to the user’s preference (spotify, apple music, youtube, amazon music, etc).


Features:

•	Reconfigurable Navigation based on device (top for mobile, side for desktop/tablet portrait mode). Navigation menu should always be accessible.

•	Instagram/Social media feed embedded into news page.

•	Gallery

•	Contact email form

•	Subscribe to mailing list (for shows, etc)

•	Discography (linking where to buy or stream):

The landing page: 
This page will feature a nice professional image (hero-image) of the band of some sort.

Contact:
This page will feature an email form where the user can contact the band or sign up for their newsletter to be notified of releases and shows.

Gallery: 
a collection of photos curated by the band.

News: 
a collection of Instagram articles to keep the page alive.

Inspiration and sites looked at: 
•	ilovemetric.com (do not like the navigation not always being accessible)

•	Menzingers.com (nice classy hero image, but do not like it focusing on merchandise).

•	Spanishlovesongs.com (kind of nice scroll down, revealing the images, and finally getting to what matters – reservations to the actual live events. – will have to check as bands I am probably working with won’t have a tour system in place)

•	Mogwai.scot – more or less functional, but not very exciting
