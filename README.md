<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<br>
This is a template for a band website. It is meant to give visitors a brief idea about the band, starting with the news section where visitors can be kept up to date with their latest shows or releases. Unlike a business or documentary website, the infomration displayed here is suplementary to the music itself, so the website aims to provide additional information to the bands fans, and direct them to streaming platforms where they can listen to the music itself.

Because the website is directed at a younger audience, the website makes heavy use of photos as backgrounds, with the text infomration displayed over it, following the band's aesthetic and style. As with the music itself, the users are most likely drawn to experimentalism in the images themselves, although like any website, this one still must maintain its purpose of informing its public on relevant information such as shows and releases.

<br>
<h1>FEATURES:</h1>

•	Navigation that is always accessible to users through a floating header at the top of the page.

•	Social Media links giving audience a way to connect with the band in their preferred platform.

•	Responsive gallery that fits the screen size and adpats to fit the number pictures.

•	Contact email form

•	Discography that directs the user to the band's music on most popular streaming platforms.
<br>
<br>
<h1>LANDING PAGE:</h1>

•	This page contains most of the relevant information starting with the latest news. By scrolling down, users are able to immediately access other information such as the band's history and the discography, where they will find links taking them to the streaming services/stores. At all times, they can jump directly to the relevant section by clicking on one of the links in the floating header menu above.
<br>
<br>
<h1>CONTACT:</h1>
<br>
<br>

•	This page contains a simple form where users can contact the band via email.

<br>
<br>
<h1>GALLERY:</h1>

•	A collection of images, of whatever the band feels important to diplay. This would likely be picture of shows, or even the posters for the shows themslves. As with the news section, this is also content that belongs in the band's hands and not a webmaster as in a traditional website, as the nature of this audience/userbase is so used to dynamic lively content.
<br>
<br>


<h1>POST-MORTEM/CONSIDERATIONS:</h1>
<br>

•	Would have liked to include a social media feed on the news section to enable the band to post frequent updates, freeing them from the dependency of having a webmaster to update a site everytime there is a change (which should be frequent for this sort of user and their audience).
<br>
<br>
•	Layout could be much better optimized for mobile devices. The original vision for the website relied on text over images. While it looks correct in full screen form, it is a bit cluttered in mobile mode. I would like to go back and restructure this whole part, cleaning up both html and css. At first I had hoped to create general rules that could be reaplied to the whole layout (I'd find that cleaner), but found css to be a bit different (and more specific) in the way it is reused than I had originall thought. Now that I know, I would probably appraoach the general structure in a different way.
<br>
<br>
•	It was suggested to me I use bootstrap. I do see a benefit of using it for things like the navigation menu and maybe a few others, but ultimately chose to avoid it at this stage for the sake of not over-complicating things more (and also because it would be more educational at this point). I would hope it could offer me some cleaner methods of creating less cluttered content when in responsive mode. I feel in general, the website could be optimized for mobile devices, and bootstrap does seem to offer some helpful tools for that.
